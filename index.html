                It's the year 2122. The specific time of year holds little significance, 
                especially when you're light-years away from any weather to experience. 
                You're a scavengerâ€”an explorer of abandoned wrecks, seeking anything of 
                value that was left behind or could be salvaged. Despite the vastness 
                of space, you're not entirely alone on this journey. Most ships come 
                equipped with a standard personality unit known as V.I., a Virtual 
                Intelligence designed to keep you company amidst the cosmic isolation.
