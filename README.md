#### Explore the Cosmos, Salvage Your Destiny
In this unique experience, users step into the boots of a daring space scrapper, navigating the vast reaches of the cosmos. Your mission? Uncover the secrets of the main module of a space station, recently rediscovered floating abandoned on the edge of known space. Delve into the mysteries is just a bonus though, as answers won't stop the galaxy's greatest monster: crushing debts. 

#### Features of the Cosmic Expedition:
Interactive Career Exploration: Navigate your character's career as a shipwreck scrapper, making pivotal decisions that shape your fate.

Space Station Mysteries: Unearth the secrets of the main module, solving puzzles and facing challenges as you rediscover a lost piece of the galaxy.

Profit-Oriented: Strategize and scavenge wisely to accumulate the profits needed for your daring escape from the clutches of financial doom.

#### Why did I build Module One?
This was made over the course of several weeks as I completed the GetCoding program and was a refresher so that I could wipe the rust off my coding skills. Considering the goal of this first project was to learn (or in my case, relearn) coding skills, I decided to make use of my background of playing TTRPGs and create a game.

#### Future Features:
Continuing the Exploration of the Station: While the current release of the game is where I wish it to be on a technical front, I am not yet done with the story. There are mysteries yet to be put to word and profits yet to be found.

Changing Images: Enhance the appearance of the game by adding dynamically changing images that reflect the scenes and atmosphere, further immersing players in the adventure.

Go Back: Reverting back a move to the previous page.
