#### Why did I build Module One?
This was made over the course of several weeks as I completed the GetCoding program and was a refresher so that I could wipe the rust off my coding skills. Considering the goal of this first project was to learn (or in my case, relearn) coding skills, I decided to make use of my background of playing TTRPGs and create a game.
